Develop Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based on paper by S. Arniriparian, M. Freitag, N. Cummins, M. Gerczuk, S. Pugachevskiy, and B. Schu ller, “A Fusion of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks and Sequence to Sequence Autoencoders for Acoustic Scene Classification,”.

The .ipynb file contain scripts for develop and training DCGAN model
